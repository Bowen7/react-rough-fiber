# FAQ

### Why can't I get the context value?

React Context currently cannot be shared across React renderers(see [react#17275](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17275)).

If you want to use context in `RoughSVG`(and React >= 18.0.0), you can use `WCRoughSVG` instead of `RoughSVG`.
`WCRoughSVG` use [`its-fine`](https://github.com/pmndrs/its-fine) to forwarded context between providers.

### Is `react-rough-fiber` work with any SVG?

No. `react-rough-fiber` is a React renderer, so it only works with SVG elements created by React.

If you create an SVG elemet manually(like `document.createElement`) or use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `react-rough-fiber` cannot work with it.

But you can use like [`react-inlinesvg`](https://github.com/gilbarbara/react-inlinesvg) to load SVGs as React elements. See the [example](/examples/inline-svg).
